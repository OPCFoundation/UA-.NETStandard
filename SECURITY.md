# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version will receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The OPC Foundation publishes security bulletins that affect software that it maintains or distributes. In many cases these bulletins will affect code that OPC vendors incorporate into their products. As a result, vendors will have to patch their products to address the vulnerabilities identified.

All the bulletins that have been published are available [here](https://opcfoundation.org/security-bulletins/).

Any vulnerabilities or security concerns should be reported to ‘securityteam AT opcfoundation DOT org’.
A PGP key to encrypt any sensitive security report can be found [here](https://opcfoundation.org/SecurityBulletins/securityteam_public_key.txt).
